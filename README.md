Advent of Code
==============

Entries for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

2018
----
For this year I have decided to do [25 days in 25 languages](https://techtinkering.com/articles/advent-of-code-2018-25-days-25-languages/).  Each day will have a solution in [tcl](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/). Then for all but the first day there will be another in a different language.

Languages so far: Tcl, Ruby, C, Python, Racket, Pascal
